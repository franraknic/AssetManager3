# AssetManager3

Simple prototype for a multi-platform Asset Manager application. QR codes are a unique ID for an asset, when scanned the user is prompted with entering a new asset, when an existing code is scanned the user updates the fields of an asset - aimed to be developed for a specific asset type and use case. When/if the development continues a Kotlin re-write would be first on the TODO. The server-side code is in [this repository](https://github.com/franraknic/asset3).

Built using:
* Retrofit
